# kaggle_Camera_Model_Identification

#### This repo is used to record the code and files that I writed when kaggle-Camera_Model_Identification.
  
***********************************************************************************************************
#### The code includes downloading and augmenting the data, caffe model and super parameters, ensembling the models and testing models.
### First step:
#### Augment the data using the eight possible processing operations. 
### Second step: 
#### Trained the models (Resnet50, Resnet101, InceptionResnetV2, SeResneXt50) using the pretrained models.
### Third step:
#### Test the models using single crop or multi crops.
### Last step:
#### Ensemble the models.
